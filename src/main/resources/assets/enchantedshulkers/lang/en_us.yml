text.autoconfig.enchantedshulkers:
  title: Enchanted Shulkers Client Settings
  option:
    glintWhenPlaced: Apply glint to placed containers
    glintWhenPlaced.@Tooltip[0]: Applies the enchantment glint to enchanted shulker boxes
    glintWhenPlaced.@Tooltip[1]: and ender chests that are placed in the world

    customModels: Prevent glint overlap with custom models
    customModels.@Tooltip[0]: Uses different block models and textures for closed containers
    customModels.@Tooltip[1]: to prevent overlapping glint. This does not change the look
    customModels.@Tooltip[2]: of closed containers, but always uses the vanilla textures,
    customModels.@Tooltip[3]: so you should disable this when using a custom resource pack.
    customModels.@Tooltip[4]: This option only has effect when the above option is on

    refillInInventory: Refill while inventory is open
